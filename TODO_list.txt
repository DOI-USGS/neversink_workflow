Neversink notebooks todo list:
- combine 0 and 1 (Mike)
- make flow chart with file names/paths (do at end)
- make notebook registry file(s) in markdown with text that explains files and strategy (Nick)
- number preprocessing notebooks 
    - break into pre-modflow and pre-pest (Mike)
    - add comments (both)
- refactor sciencebase --> source_data (both)
- update paths in yaml and scripts (Nick)


NOTES and ISSUES:
- notebook 0.4_k_zone_padding can only be run after building the morel - 
            maybe move to PEST setup?
- notebook 0.5_inspect_parent_models requires all the big NGWM files - skip?
- ditto for 0.6_merge_parent_models.ipynb
