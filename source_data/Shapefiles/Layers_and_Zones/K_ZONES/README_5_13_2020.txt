NEW K ZONE (Version2) uploaded.
******

Enclosed in this directory are the layer elevation surfaces, and K-zone distributions.

Details provided below:


1. Folder 'Elevations'

L1_Bottom.tif = Bottom elevations for layer 1 of the model.

L2_Bottom.tif = Bottom elevations for layer 2 of the model.

L3_Bottom__TopOfBedrock.tif = Bottom elevations for layer 3 of the model -- this is also the top of bedrock elevations for the model.

Mosaic_meters_2.0_CLIPPED.tif = Lidar for study area.  Combination of multiple lidar collections.

ZonalStats_lidar_125ft = Lidar upscaled to our model grid (125x125 ft).  This is showing the lidar MINIMUM for each grid cell. If you want more statistics, just let me know.





2. Folder 'K_ZONES'

Layer1_K.tif = Layer 1 K zone delineations for the model. 

Layer2_K.tif = Layer 2 K zone delineations for the model. 

Layer3_K.tif = Layer 3 K zone delineations for the model. 

Layer4_K.tif = Layer 4 K zone delineations for the model. 

K_Layers_Polygon = Shapefile showing the polygon shapes of all K delineations.

Rondout_Neversink_GeologyLookupTable = Lookup_Code corresponds to the codes seen in Layer_K.tifs.
 ****The geology in this region was pretty detailed.  So we tried out best to capture that.
     If you want us to scale back our zoning, we can try to do so.****






2. Folder 'Shapefiles'

Model_Extent = Model extent, following HUC boundaries

Model_Grid_Shape_125x125 = Model grid that we used as a basis for the elevations.
